QUESTIONS:
1. User-level threads are useful when the user wants to impose a particular
order on the handling of the threads. For this, user-level threads are the best option because
kernel-level threads are scheduled by the OS and not by the user (and simply using
processes would obviously have more overhead).

2. Advantages: the strict separation of different processes' data (heap, memory, files) ensures
that the processes will not corrupt each other or gain access to protected data.
Disadvantages: creating a new process and switching between different processes has significantly
more overhead than that of threads. In addition, communication between distinct processes requires
the intervention of the operating system, unlike in kernel-level threads where the threads can perform
basic communication directly. Finally, since processes do not share memory, using multiple processes
is wasteful in terms of space.

3. While we typed the command, the keyboard sent an interrupt to the OS and required that the letters
we typed would appear onscreen in the shell. When we pressed enter, the keyboard sent an interrupt to the OS
which was handled by informing the shell that enter was pressed, and the shell then executes the command. It sends
a system call to the OS, requesting that it send SIGTERM to the process whose ID we specified. The OS did so, and
the application handled the signal SIGTERM by terminating itself (the default behavior).

4. Virtual time is the amount of time that a process takes in theory -- without the interrupts and such that
occur in real life. This is what we are calculating when we say, for example, that searching a hashmap takes O(1)
times. Real time is the actual time that the processor took to execute a command, or a series of commands. For example,
in Ex 1 when we calculated the amount of time that it takes to execute an empty function (in theory O(0) = 0), we were
calculating real time.

5. sigsetjmp saves the context of a thread in a sigjmp_buf struct -- the program counter, stack pointer, registers, and
(optionally) the relevant signal masks.
siglongjmp loads the context of the sigjmp_buf given as a parameter (assumed to be saved previously using sigsetjmp).
